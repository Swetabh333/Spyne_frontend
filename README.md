## Setting up the project Locally

To set up the project paste the follwing commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Swetabh333/Makerble.git
cd Makerble
go mod tidy
```

This will install all the required dependencies for the project.

Next you have to set the environment for the project. your root directory you have to paste the following information:

```bash
export DSN_STRING="<your_postgres_connection_string>/<your_database_name>"
export JWT_SECRET="<your_jwt_secret>"
export JWT_REFRESH_SECRET="<your_jwt_refresh_secret>"
export REDIS_URL="<your_redis_connection_url>:<port no.>"
export REDIS_PASSWORD="<your_redis_password>"
```

I have used it this way for deployment purpose as the godotenv library gives an error on not detecting an env file.

If you want to use a .env file , create a .env file in the root directory

and put these there

```
DSN_STRING="<your_postgres_connection_string>/<your_database_name>"
JWT_SECRET="<your_jwt_secret>"
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET="<your_jwt_refresh_secret>"
REDIS_URL="<your_redis_connection_url>:<port no.>"
REDIS_PASSWORD="<your_redis_password>"
```

put this piece of code in the very beginninig of init function after error declaration in app/main/main.go

```
var err error

if err = godotenv.Load(); err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Error loading .env file")
    }
//Connect to the database and return db instance
	db, err = databases.ConnectToDatabase()
```

Do the above and then in your terminal run

```bash
go get github.com/joho/godotenv
```

Now you'll have to build the project with the following command in the root directory

```bash
go build -o bin/exe app/main/main.go
```

This will create an executable in your bin folder, which you can run using

**NOTE** : make sure no other process is running on port 8080

```bash
./bin/exe
```

**Your backend is now listening at port `8080`**.

## Setting up using docker

You can use docker compose to set this up as well

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Swetabh333/Makerble.git
cd Makerble
```

then run the docker build command

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

**Your backend is now listening at port `8080`**.
